## Installation

...

## Development

There's a Dockerfile and docker-compose file for easy setup. Run the
`development` service through docker-compose to spin up a local development
environment. Additionally, there are settings and recommendations in the
`.vscode` folder; so VSCode is highly recommended for file editing. If using
VSCode as your editor, copy the contents from `.vscode/settings.public.json`
into `.vscode/settings.json` to correctly configure your editor.
